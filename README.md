# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Fine Food Reviews Using VADER and RoBERTa

This project is a comparative study of two sentiment analysis techniques ‚Äî **VADER**, a rule-based model, and **RoBERTa**, a deep learning-based NLP model ‚Äî applied to the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in understanding and classifying customer sentiments from real-world product reviews.

## üìå Project Overview

This study focuses on:
- Preprocessing textual review data
- Applying both VADER and RoBERTa for sentiment classification
- Evaluating the models using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**
- Drawing comparisons to determine which model is more effective in different scenarios

## üîç Dataset

- **Name**: Amazon Fine Food Reviews
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
- **Size**: Over 500,000 food reviews including text, rating, user, and product information

## üß† Models Used

### 1. **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**
- Rule-based sentiment analysis model
- Handles informal text, emojis, capitalization, and negations
- Best suited for social media and online reviews

### 2. **RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)**
- Transformer-based deep learning model by Facebook AI
- Pretrained on a large corpus and fine-tuned on our dataset
- Excels in understanding linguistic context and complex semantics

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization using NLTK
   - Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters

2. **Sentiment Classification**:
   - VADER applied directly to cleaned text
   - RoBERTa fine-tuned on labeled sentiment data (positive, negative, neutral)

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Used test dataset to calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## üìà Results

| Model   | Accuracy | Positive F1 | Neutral F1 | Negative F1 |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **VADER**   | ~75%     | Lower       | Medium     | Lower       |
| **RoBERTa** | **87.5%** | High        | Medium     | Moderate    |

- **RoBERTa outperformed VADER** across all sentiment categories
- RoBERTa generalizes well even for unseen data and longer reviews
- VADER was useful for informal expressions, emojis, and slang

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Deep learning models like RoBERTa provide superior performance for sentiment tasks involving contextual and semantic complexity
- VADER still holds relevance in applications where simplicity, speed, and slang handling are crucial
- Hybrid models combining rule-based and deep learning approaches could provide balanced benefits

## üìö Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
